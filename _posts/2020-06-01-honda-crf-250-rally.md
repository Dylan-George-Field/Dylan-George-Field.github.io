<p>
Low-cost, modern and mid-weight, this 157kg dual purpose bike is perfect for going around the world. It's based on the tried and tested Honda CRF250L and has a larger fuel tank, windshield, and LED headlights. I picked it up second-hand for just under $5,000 AUD with 7,000km on the clock.

<h2>Modifications</h2>
The bike is designed as a dual sport/commuter and requires some modification to become a long-range adventure bike. A huge thank you to Andy Strapz, Barkbusters, B&B Offroad Engineering and Lightforce for kindly supporting me and the adventure rider community. It makes me proud to be an aussie! 

<h3>Barkbusters VPS - Australia</h3>
<p>
A must have. The standard handguards are useless. The VPS provides ridged protection using a metal bar from the center of the handlebars to the bar-ends. They do a better job of protecting your precious hands from low-hanging branches, debris and hard hits. They stop your brake/clutch levers from snapping in a fall and they come with an optional extension to further protect your hands from rain, wind and the dreaded bugs.
</p>

<h3>Lightforce 6" lightbar - Australia</h3>
<p>
My favourite addition to the bike. This weatherproof, 6 x 5 watt lightbar over doubles the output of the standard lights. It's centrally mounted to protect it from falls using a bracket sourced from SRC Moto (USA). The supplied relay is hooked into the high-beam light with an on/off switch placed conveniently on the left hand fairing. The lightbar is secured with tie-wire and anti-theft nuts also supplied by Lightforce.
</p>

<h3>B&B Offroad Bashplate - Australia</h3>
<p>
The standard bashplate is made of a weak plastic. The fit & finish of this 4mm aluminum black bashplate is beautiful. It fits snugly underneath the bike and does not impede the standard fairings. It has foam to protect the frame and won't go anywhere once bolted on. The solid bashplate is critical for rocky mountains like the himalayas where, combined with the fully loaded weight of the bike, can punch holes into the engine case. Ending your trip.
</p>

<h3>Andy Strapz Avduro II Panniers - Australia</h3>
<p>
These soft heavy canvas bags are lightweight and strong. The size is perfect, despite telling Andy they were too small when I got them! Each pannier is 35 liters and has two large pockets for easy access to 2 liters of water, fuel, oil, tuna etc. They aren't waterproof so I coated them in a layer of beezwax. Andy supplied waterproof inner bags too.
</p>
<p>
The bags are mounted to the Tusk quick release bracket. The canvas and straps are so thick you can screw the supplied bolts directly into it. Measure the holes and where you'd like to mount it. Cut a small holes at each point with a knife and drive the screws in. I used corflute from Bunnings to make the bag more rigid. I cut off the straps that go over the seat.
</p>

<h3>Tusk Pannier Rack - USA</h3>
<p>
The pannier rack was chosen for its quick release system. Removing panniers takes me about 20 minutes and the same to put them back on. It's frustratingly difficult when alone and with a full bags of food or liquid. Time I'd rather spend riding. I had theft from my panniers overnight in Washington D.C simply because I was too lazy to remove them. This feature is a huge asset as I'd be riding through the most populated places in the world, South East Asia, Europe and to a lesser extent the Middle-East. This means staying in hostels will be more likely and may require me to park on busy streets. Having the panniers with me, next to my tent in rain or up a tree or bear safe is a huge asset.
</p>
<p>
This rack comes with a large flat top rack for a duffel bag too. The fit an finish isn't perfect and requires the removal of the passenger pegs. They are heavy due to being made of steel. Unfortunately, Australian manufactures, Barret and Outback Mototrek do not make a quick release system.
</p>

<h3>6 liter Cameltank - USA</h3>
<p>
The standard tank is 10 liters and is good for around 300km. This range isn't ideal for remote areas and one of my pet peeves is having to stop at petrol stations often. The additional 6 liters adds an extra 100km to a combined 400km. The tank is expensive but is well built and feeds automatically into the main tank via vacuum from the vent tube. A rotopax would've been a better option setup the same way if it worked with the pannier rack. Unfortunately, the tank doesn't mate well with the Tusk panniers and I had to get custom brackets made thanks to the help of the boys at Motocraft, Mordialloc.
</p>

<h3>Quad Lock Phone Mount - Australia</h3>
<p>
My first Quad Lock failed after 10,000 miles on my last trip. It slowly shook itself to death before my phone went flying off the bike on the Interstate at 80mph. I went to the office in Melbourne and they took (possibly my) feedback on board and designed a new faceplate made of a stronger plastic resin and rubber o'ring to reduce vibration. The Quad Lock is a great and simple system. It is mounted to the windscreen bar and does not restrict the view of the instrument cluster with an iPhone 6S.
</p>

<h3>Protaper Pillow Top Grip - USA</h3>
<p>
The standard grips are small and hard. They do the job but I wanted to add heated grips so I figured I'd change these as well. The pillow tops are much softer and help reduce the vibration caused by the single-cylinder. The throttle tube was a pain to get on and required some carving with a knife to get them to fit.
</p>
<h3>Heated Handgrips - China</h3>
<p>
A cheap $15 pair of heated elements from Ebay. They are no where near as good as the Oxford ones. I didn't like the grips on them so I installed these. They get warm, not hot. It's better than nothing when riding early morning at altitude. The switch is installed on the left-hand side fairing panel.
</p>
<h3>Unifilter Foam Air Filter - Australia</h3>
<p>
The air-filter must be replaced at 25,000km. That puts me somewhere in the Middle-East. I could carry a spare but, if anything happens to it I would have to improvise on the road. I opted for this as it's washable and means I don't have to worry about it. A small 'R/C' foam air filter oil bottle is carried on the bike.
</p>
<h3>SSB Lithium Ion Battery - Australia</h3>
<p>
The lithium battery is over half the weight of the standard acid one. Being an underpowered 250 with a lot of weight on board, any effort to reduce it is welcome. The standard battery was 3-years old and I decided to replace it. It could've been fine but I rather not risk becoming stranded. 
</p>
<h3>USB Chargers x3 - China</h3>
<p>
One charger next to the phone. Two chargers on the right hand side panel. The phone charger is connected directly to the battery and has a mini-lightning cable. It will charge without the ignition. The other twin charger has a button for on/off regardless of ignition. It's to charge one of many usb-charged devices in the front-pannier pocket. I carry a: headlight, powerbank, camera and kindle.
</p>
<h3>Osprey Transporter 40L (Top Bag) - USA</h3>
<p>
This is a superb bag. It's not a drybag but fairly waterproof and with a bag cover. I prefer this as it has a flat-bottom, low-cost and great build quality. The main features I wanted were the two handles it has at the top. Ideal for pulling on and off the bike. It comes with backpack straps too so I can take it and my two panniers in one go. It has a couple of pockets and is the perfect size for carry-on for my overseas junkets.
</p>
<h3>Wolfman Tank/Pannier Pockets - USA</h3>
<p>
These came with the bike. A small tank bag that doesn't impede the steering plus two large pockets up front. These simple bags help spread the weight across the bike. Not by much. They are used to carry devices to be charged and soft items that protect the lower fairings in case of a fall. They stop some wind and rain from hitting your legs too.
</p>
<h3>Upper Pannier Pockets - France</h3>
<p>
These are cheap 'bicycle frame bags' I got from Decathlon for $15 each. I sewed some compression straps to them to carry some tools and my toiletries. Located on the upper front fairing.
</p>
<h3>Lowered Seat - Myself</h3>
<p>
The seat is lowered by about 1.5 inches. This was done myself using a bread knife, some sandpaper and a staple gun. Remove the seat, take out the staples and cut out the foam. Re-attach the seat and replace the staples.
</p>
<h3>Glasses Case - China</h3>
<p>
A small glasses case is connected to the handlebars. I wear glasses and when I take off my helmet I always forget where I put them. I ride off and never find them again.
</p>
<h3>Adjust Rear Spring Preload - Myself</h3>
<p>
The stock bike comes with a saggy bottom. You can tighten the pre-load of the rear. This is great for the heavy weight over the rear end and will stiffen up the front as well. All you need to do is remove the side fairing then use a hole punch and hammer to move the circular clips above the shock.
