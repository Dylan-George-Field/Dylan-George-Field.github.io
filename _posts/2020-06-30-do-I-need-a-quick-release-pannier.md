  Yes.
</p>

<p>
  A quick release system saves you time, frustration and gives you piece of mind that no one will steal your shit. Bears included 🐻
</p>

<p>
  It takes 1 minute to get the panniers on/off instead of 20 minutes. That's 19 minutes I'd rather be riding, drinking beer or enjoying a hot shower after a miserable wet day.
</p>

<p>
  No one enjoys taking panniers off. Try holding up a 10kg pannier with your knee while trying to tie or untie those dirty crusted straps. "I can't wait to take my panniers off", said no one ever.
</p>

<p>
  And that's how your shit gets stolen. I had someone go through my panniers and steal my first aid kit in Washington D.C. I left stuff on the bike because I couldn't be assed taking my panniers off and carrying it all in 🙄
</p>

<p>
  Bears also like to steal things. So you need to put all your food in a safe, car or up a tree. A quick release makes that process smoother. Make sure you do it or it will knock over your bike and rip your bags to shreds.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking of camping. You may have to trek to a campsite without the bike. Pull the bags off and walk. It beats having to go back because you forgot your Campbell's soup.
</p>

<p>
  The same applies to rain. Do you really want to awkwardly clamber out of your tent, put your boots to get something out of them in the rain? No way!
</p>

<p>
  You can use an inner bag. It's a great idea if you're on the cheap. Me, I'd rather spend the extra bucks and take it all in one. Those pannier bags are expensive enough!
</p>

<h3>Check it out yourself</h3>
<p>
  It takes 1 minute even for a numpty like me.
