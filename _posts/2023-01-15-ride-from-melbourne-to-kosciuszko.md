I did a short 1652km trip from Melbourne to Mt. Kosciuszko and back.

I dislocated my finger coming down the notorious Billy Goat Bluff Track. I was lucky to have reception. I managed to organise the bike to be recovered. Meanwhile a couple of 4WDers took me back to Dargo where I'd organised a lift with a friend from my hometown of Sale. I was discharged from hospital at 1am. It was a total 5 hours before I was seen by a doctor.

I continued the trip and reached Thredbo the following day. The bike was collected from Admiral Towing, Moe. It was a fair ride and I managed to test the finger on couple of dirt tracks. It was slightly painful. I was determined to get to the top of Mt. Kosciuszko after my failed attempt the previous year where I burnt the clutch out on the bike.

Mt. Kociuszko is beautiful. The hike is a 10km up and back. There was snow in sections that require you on all fours. The chairlift is a great way up and the boardwalk makes it easy. I suggest taking a jumper in Summer. It took me a few hours to get to the top and return.

There were a few trails I went up on my way home to Benambra. I navigated some simple fire trails that were easy on my finger. The fires did a number out there. I made it to Benambra pub and camped out the back. The manager was great and so was the food and company. I highly recommend staying.

The following day I planned to ride from Mt. Beauty to Mt. Hotham to Dargo. I didn't make it. I crashed in Fall's Creek and the road was blocked by a landslide. I ended up doubling back and I got stuck on a track back where I started near the Blue Duck Inn. The front brake line got knocked in the stack and lost fluid. I had to nurse the bike down the trails. I eventually got out after a medium river crossing. I got rained on after. Not ideal.

I stayed at the Omeo pub on the hill. I fixed the brake and topped it up with fluid. I had dinner with a couple of other riders.

The ride back was via Dargo High Plains Road. It was a nice one. It was slick in sections due to the rain the following day but it was enough to keep me awake. A couple of other riders found it challending. I opened the throttle and flew by them dakar style. I learned this much from the outback.

The highway home was uneventful. I made it back in time to return my PLB to macpac by 5pm and caught the fireworks with friends. Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰
