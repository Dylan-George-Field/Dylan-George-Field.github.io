  You need USB chargers. Multiple redundant USB chargers. There's no way around it. Everything electrically important to your adventure depends on it. They break, so make sure you have one or two as backup and they are tested!
</p>

<p>
  Seriously. They will fail somewhere within the few hours mark. Try them in rain and extreme hot/cold. I rely on my phone being charged. I can do without it but it's a huge pain in the ass.
</p>

<h3>Things to charge (order of importance)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Emergency locator - Must be charged at all times</li>
  <li>Phone</li>
  <li>Powerbank</li>
  <li>Headlamp</li>
  <li>Camera</li>
  <li>GoPro</li>
  <li>Kindle</li>
</ol>

<h3>Single Charger</h3>
<p>
  Is already playing up. It charges my phone while mounted for Navigation. It's a power hungry task and I spend a lot of time at shops to use wifi. I plot out where I'm going, contact people and update family & friends. The phone always needs to be charged. The USB port is connected directly to the battery so it's always on.
</p>

<p>
  I keep a spare phone charger as well.
</p>

<h3>Twin Charger</h3>
<p>
  I can charge two devices and keep them in the <a href="{% post_url 2020-07-20-front-tank-panniers %}">front tank pannier</a>. Given the order of importance above. The twin charger has an on/off button and is not tied to the ignition.
