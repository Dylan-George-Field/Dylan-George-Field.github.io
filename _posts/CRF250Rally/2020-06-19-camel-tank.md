<h2>Camel Tank 6 Litre - USA</h2>
<h3>Cost - $430 USD</h3>
<h4><a href="https://camel-adv.com/">camel-adv.com</a></h4>
<p>
  The standard CRF250 Rally comes with a 10.1 litre tank. It's good for around 300km @ 3l/100km. It isn't enough for long-haul adventure riding plus, no one likes refueling. 
</p>

<p>
  The Camel Tank adds an extra 100km range to the bike. The system taps into the main tank via the vent hose. It sucks in fuel from the Camel Tank to your main tank as you're riding. This clever vacuum technique can be applied to a rotopax or any sealed external fuel tank. You only need a bit of tube!
</p>
<p>
  Be careful to install it on the vent tube and not the overflow!
</p>

  The tank is expensive. The fit, finish and quality is excellent. It levels out the weight of the exhaust pipe and sits safely and protected at the rear of the bike. The last thing you want is to go up in flames üî•

<p>
  You can grab an IMS tank for an extra 3 litres for $280 USD (<a href="https://www.imsproducts.com/">www.imsproducts.com</a>). It costs a little less per litre with the Cameltank. You can do both and achieve a range of over 450km. A fuel bladder will get you even higher ‚òù

  The Camel Tank does not fit with a Tusk Pannier rack! You can make it work by tilting it and using custom CNC cut brackets to hold it in place. A big thanks to Bikecraft Mordialloc (<a href="www.bikecraft.net.au">www.bikecraft.net.au</a>) for hooking this up for me.
