  I have a bone to pick with this local Melbourne based company. I had their product branded for motorcycles, fail on my <a href="{% post_url 2018-11-03-usa-tour %}">
  trip around the USA.</a> Which they denied could happen before redesigning their product based on my feedback üôÑ

  They tried to send me a replacement in their defense. You just don't know where you'll be on an adventure ride or how long parts take to fly to from Australia > USA. Their smugness and indifference to my situation didn't help either.

  A phone mount is crucial to adventure. You can't navigate a foreign land easily without one. The roadways are different, you're probably on the other side of the road and trying hard not to die while you're lost 100% of the time. It's no easy feat without a well mounted GPS.

  This was the only thing to fail on my 35,000km journey. It hurts because it's a crucial component. It simply wasn't designed for this purpose. It's for bicycles and cars. Plastic is not strong enough for dual sport adventure riding. They just slapped a motorbike label on the box and didn't test it. I did and it failed, bad. 
</p>

<p>
  I went to the office to give them a second chance. A lady and engineer observed the leftover pieces of their Quad Lock. They were surprised and unapologetic. They replaced it for free. I told them I was going on a 50,000km trip from Melbourne to London and I need a guarantee it won't fail. The engineer said it's made of a new resin and has a rubber o-ring to prevent vibration (see video).

<p>
  I asked for 5 replacement faces. One for each 10,000km that the last one failed. The engineer looked disgusted at my suggestion. He gave me one and told it won't fail. My apologies if I offend you for asking for a 10 cent replaceable component because I don't trust you.
</p>

<p>
  The lady charged me $35 AUD for a new case. I updated my iPhone from a 5S > 6S. It's not a fault of theirs we agreed awkwardly. It should've been offered free out of goodwill.

  I never got to test the new Quad Lock. My trip is cancelled due to Covid. I have done 500km of dual sport riding and so far it's held up. It's a long way to 10,000 miles. We'll find out soon enough. I appreciate you took my feedback on board for you new design, it's just a shame you treated me like shit and never said thanks.
</p>

<p>
  What's more filth is they have a model GS adventure bike in their office yet don't give much of a stuff about us. Otherwise, it's a good device, just remember your phone could get smashed on the highway with pre-longed use.

  I recommend the <a href="https://shop-hondogarage.com/products/perfect-squeeze-phone-mount" target="_blank">Hondo squeeze (USA)</a> the mean time üëç
