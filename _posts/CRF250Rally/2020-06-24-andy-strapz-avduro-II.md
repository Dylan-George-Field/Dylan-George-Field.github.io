<p>
  Simple and tough, this Melbourne made roll-top design is made of a thick one piece canvas. The bottom has no seams where tears are most likely to occur. The absence of zippers makes the bag easy-to-access and big buckles for when you have motorbike gloves on.
</p>

<p>
  Each bag has a 20L capacity. They come with two large pockets that hold a 2L. These are great for quick access items like water bottles or things you don't want inside the bag like oil or fuel. It's the perfect size for any solo-travel adventure and only weigh 2kgs.
</p>

<p>
  The bags have a slim 15cm profile. They are tall and long instead of wide. This helps get you through narrow passages like single trails, traffic or other tight spots. It's important when travelling in high density countries like Asia, especially in Summer.
</p>

<p>
  The main drawback is they aren't waterproof. They will survive drizzles but not a downpour or submersion. You can put your things in plastic bags or use Andy's waterproof liners to solve it. It's not a big problem as I do that anyway to prevent food and liquids going everywhere. I gave my bags a coat of beezwax/sno-seal.
</p>

  Thanks to Andy who supplied these at a discounted rate. He asked for a couple of newsletter articles in return.
