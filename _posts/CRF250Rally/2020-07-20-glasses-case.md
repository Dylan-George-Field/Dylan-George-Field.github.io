  I lost 7 pairs of glasses on my trip around the USA. Two of them were prescription. They cost me about $300 AUD. It was a costly lesson as I need them to see long distance, especially at night time in the rain. It meant I couldn't see clearly and I missed all the stars!

  I lost them because I have to take my glasses off with my helmet. I have an awful habit of placing them somewhere on the bike and I forget them. I ride a few miles before I realise they're gone.. I had to keep buying new ones from Walmart for 4 bucks.

  The solution was to strap a cheap glasses case to the handlebars. I put four holes in it and put a cable tie through it. I won't forget them as long as I put them there every time ðŸ¤“
