  The standard handguards are shit so I threw them in the bin.
</p>
<p>
  You need a strong two-point handguard. One with a strong piece of metal secured tightly from the middle of the handlebar to the bar-end. You need these for a few reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>They protect your hands from being crushed against a trees (bark.. get it?), rocks or the corners of cars.</li>
  <li>They stop your brake/clutch leavers from snapping in a fall (and I fall a lot).</li>
  <li>They protect your hands from rain, wind and bugs</li>
  <li>They look sick</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are a tight fit on the standard CRF250 Rally handlebars. They won't hit the windshield at full lock. Contact Barkbusters to make sure they fit your rig.

  Thanks to Barkbusters for supplying them! üëç
