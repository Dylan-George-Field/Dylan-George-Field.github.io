  This rock solid 4mm aluminum solid bashplate replaces the flimsy plastic one that comes standard on the CRF250 Rally. The fit and finish is perfect. It slots into the fairings seamlessly, the bolts line up and its a cinch to install. There's even a careful layer of foam where the plate touches the frame.

  The plate will put up with more than anything I can throw at it. Admittedly, not a lot. I'm not the kind of person to be jumping a fully loaded adventure bike over sharp objects. The himalayas are rocky and I'm better safe than sorry. A punch in the belly of the engine will ruin your entire trip.

  A big thank you to B&B Offroad Engineering Ballarat for supplying this. Be sure to checkout their range of custom fabricated protection for your bike.
