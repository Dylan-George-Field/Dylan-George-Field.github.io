<h2>Decathlon - France</h2>
<h3>Cost - $40 AUD</h3>

  Pannier pockets are expensive if you buy motorbike specific ones. The Giant Loop ones are $150. I can't justify that. I just wanted some bags to store tyre tubes in. I decided to find an alternative.

  I found these bicycle frame bags at Decathlon. They cost $15 each. I bought a couple of sleeping bag compression straps and sticked them with a needle and thread. I did a double stitch with a cross. The straps are stuck on tight. Unfortunately, the tubes don't fit.

  These are perfect for toiletries and tools instead. They are easy to get access to from the bike. No more digging into the rear panniers to find my toothbrush!
