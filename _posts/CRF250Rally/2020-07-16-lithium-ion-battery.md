  You need a reliable battery for a long-distance trip. The CRF is around 2 years old and has the original battery. It works fine, for how long I'm not sure. Given my trip from Melbourne to London would take around 7-9 months. I'd rather not risk it.

  I replaced the original Yuasa YTZ8V acid battery with a lithium ion. SSB recommends the LH7L-BS for the CRF250 Rally and it fits perfectly. It is over half the weight and saves about 1.5kg. It's unbelievable. Great for a small capacity bike with low power and already weighed down by gear.

  The battery has performed flawlessly over the last 3 months. It comes with a digital voltage meter. The lithium ion batteries do well in extreme hot/cold temperatures. However, I never got to test it.

  Check with the manufacturer to get the right battery for your bike or vehicle.
