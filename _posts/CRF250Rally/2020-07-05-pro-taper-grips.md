  The standard grips are small and hard. I don't love them and I have to take them off to install heated elements. I took the opportunity to replace them with Pro Taper Pillow Tops after I saw another bike with them on advrider's <a href="https://advrider.com/f/threads/honda-crf250-rally-owners.1212233/" target="_blank">Honda CRF250 Rally Owners</a> thread.

  The grips look great, dampen vibrations and are bigger. I chose grey to match the red,black, white colour scheme. The soft compound helps dampen the vibrations from the single-cylinder engine on long highway stretches and the larger diameter is more comfortable for my, what I considered, small hands.

<p>
  I'm thrilled with the choice. It's a cheap modification that improved comfort substantially for me. Alternatively, you can install a pair of <a href="https://www.oxfordproducts.com/motorcycle/product_type/accessories/handlebar_accessories/heated_grips/" target="_blank">Oxford Heated grips</a>.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  The throttle grip is hard to install. It's too small for the tube. I shaved down the plastic burs on the throttle tube to make the diameter smaller. I wrapped the tube in tape to reduce friction when putting the grip on. I lubed it with a heap of Windex. It took a lot of pressure.
