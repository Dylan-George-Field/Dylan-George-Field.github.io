  The standard grips are small, hard and uncomfortable. I don't love them and I need to take them off to install heated elements. I decided to replace them with Pro Taper Pillow Tops after I saw another bike with them on advrider's <a href="https://advrider.com/f/threads/honda-crf250-rally-owners.1212233/" target="_blank">Honda CRF250 Rally Owners</a> thread.

<p>
  These grips look great, dampen vibrations and are bigger. The grey ones match the bike's colour scheme. The soft compound helps dampen the vibrations from the single-cylinder engine and the large diameter is more comfortable for my, what I consider, small hands.
</p>

<p>
  I'm thrilled with the choice. It's a cheap mod that improved comfort substantially. The <a href="https://www.oxfordproducts.com/motorcycle/product_type/accessories/handlebar_accessories/heated_grips/" target="_blank">Oxford Heated grips</a> are a good alternative.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  The throttle grip is hard to install. It's too small for the tube. I shaved down the plastic burs on the throttle tube and sanded it down to make the diameter smaller. I lubed it with a heap of Windex. It takes a lot of elbow grease to get it on.
