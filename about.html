	<p>I want to inspire you to see the world.</p>

	<p>A world where you're immersed and connected. You'll strange and colourful characters.

	<p>You've feel alive and I'm going to show you how.</p>

	<p>--------</p>

	<p>I grew up on a farm in Sale, Victoria, where my dad taught us how to ride (pictured below). 
		We rode trails on weekends when camping as a kid. I was never any good but I got my road license when I was 18. 
		Thats when I learned about freedom.</p>

	<p>My dream was to ride the USA. It took me 5 years to save the money.</p>
	
	<p>I did it in 2018. And it was incredible.</p>
