	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I want to inspire you to get on a bike and see the world.</p>

	<p>To feel the air, the harshness of the ground beneath you and the sting of the sun and rain.</p>

	<p>Travelling by bike is the ultimate, low-cost and immersive way to travel.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Sale, Victoria, where my dad taught us how to ride on a farm (below). We rode trails on weekends while camping as a kid. 
		I got my road license when I was 18 and experienced the endless freedom of turning a throttle on an open road.</p>

	<p>My dream was to ride the USA. I did it in 2018. It took me 5 years to finish university, find a job and save the money.
		I took the opportunity and came back with memories that will last forever.</p>
	
	<p>This blog is about my travel, doing the thing I love.</p>
