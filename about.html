	<h2>Mission</h2>

	<p>I want to inspire you to see the world.</p>
	
	<p>To feel the wind through your fingers and the earth between your toes. You'll discover incredible people, 
		their stories and struggles. Find exciting places and explore the land in-between.
		Face your fears, challenge yourself and you will become a better person.

	<p>All you need is a motorbike.</p>

	<h2>Dylan</h2>

	<p>My dad taught me how to ride a motorbike on a farm in, Sale, Victoria (pictured below). 
		We rode trails on weekends while camping as a kid. I got my road license when I was 18 and have ridden ever since.

	your next adventure, <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
