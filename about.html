	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>I'm here to inspire you to get on a bike and see the world.</p>

	<p>I grew up in Sale, Victoria, where my dad taught us how to ride on the farm (below). We rode trails while camping as a kid. 
		I got my road license when I was 18.</p>

	<p>Touring the USA by motorbike was my dream. I did it in 2018. It took me 5 years to get there and I came back with memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
